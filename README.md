Identifying disease-indicative genes is critical for deciphering disease mechanisms and continues to attract significant interest. Spatial transcriptomics offers unprecedented insights for
the detection of disease-specific genes by enabling within-tissue contrasts. However, this new
technology poses challenges for conventional statistical models developed for RNA-seq, as
these models often neglect the spatial organization of tissue spots. In this article, we propose
a Bayesian shrinkage model to characterize the relationship between high-dimensional gene
expressions and the disease status of tissue spots, incorporating spatial correlation among
these spots through autoregressive terms. Our model adopts a hierarchical structure to
accommodate for the missing data within tissues and is further extended to facilitate the
analysis of multiple correlated samples. To ensure the modelâ€™s applicability to datasets of
varying sizes, we carry out two computational frameworks for Bayesian parameter estimation, tailored to both small and large sample scenarios. 

## Installation

The **DiSTect** package depends on two core packages: **rstan** and **rjags**.  
Please ensure both dependencies are installed before installing DiSTect.

### Step 1. Install Dependencies

#### For all systems
To install **rstan**, run the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("rstan", dependencies = TRUE)
```

#### For macOS users
First, install JAGS via Homebrew in your terminal:
```bash
brew install jags
```

Then install rjags from source in R:
```r
install.packages("rjags", type = "source")
```

#### For Windows users
Please visit the JAGS official website
 to download and install JAGS manually.
After that, install rjags in R:
```r
install.packages("rjags")
```

### Step 2. Install DiSTect
Once all dependencies are installed, use the following commands to install DiSTect from GitHub:
```r
# install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# install the DiSTect package
devtools::install_github("StaGill/DiSTect")

# load the package
library(DiSTect)
```
